title: "2013 Basic FIRST Hardware "
---
This blog is meant to discuss general training items for FIRST robotics teams. &nbsp;While it is focused primarily on the McKinley Tech Firebirds, it could be useful for anyone. <br /><br />With the large number of Freshmen on our team for 2014, we need to start with the basics. &nbsp;FIRST has some training materials on their website, usfirst.org, under<span style="color: cyan;"> <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/2013-Technical-Resources" target="_blank"><span style="color: cyan;">FRC, Resources.</span></a></span><br /><br /><br />While you could look over every link in the system, many of these are step by step directions on how to load software or configure hardware. &nbsp;(Useful, but confusing to someone not very familiar with the systems.)<br /><br />Start with the<span style="color: cyan;">&nbsp;<a href="http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/3120/m/8559/l/90113-2013-frc-control-system-hardware-overview" target="_blank"><span style="color: cyan;">hardware overview.</span></a></span><br />The hardware overview is very important, because it shows you a picture of every component, and a very brief description of its function. &nbsp;Every member of the team should know the name and function of all 15 items this overview.<br /><br /><a href="http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/3120/m/8559" target="_blank"><span style="color: cyan;">Getting Started with the 2013 Control System&nbsp;</span></a><br />is training put out by WPI.<br /><br /><a href="http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/3120/m/8559/l/92626-wiring-the-2013-frc-control-system" target="_blank"><span style="color: cyan;">Training manual on wiring </span></a>each component of the FIRST control system.<br /><br /><a href="http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/3120/m/8559/l/101397-light-codes-on-control-system-components" target="_blank"><span style="color: cyan;">Technical manual on the status lights of FIRST components</span></a><br />These lights tell you something about what the control component/system is doing, and can give important clues for troubleshooting. <br /><br />Some interesting items, which could help the team troubleshoot drive system problems!<br /><br />A good manual on<span style="color: cyan;"> <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/sites/default/files/uploadedFiles/Robotics_Programs/FRC/Game_and_Season__Info/2013/2013FRCPneumaticsInfo_RevC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color: cyan;">Pneumatics</span></a></span><br /><br />The three documents I mention above are an excellent place to start learning about FIRST. &nbsp; In future potst, I plan to cover how to get Autodesk Inventor, a very good Computer Aided Design program, on your computer, and some very good tutorials from National Instruments on programming the FIRST control system in LabView. &nbsp;I plan to include object detection and identification using a camera and the LabView software. <br /><br />Jim Grove<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
