title: "RGB LED Light Strips"
---
Many teams are now using Light Strips to decorate their pit area and/or their robot. &nbsp;These go by various names, and some are slightly different technologies, but they are all based on having LED lights in a shape (usually a strip, sometimes a block or a ring).<br /><br />Here are some interesting links:<br /><a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide?view=all" target="_blank"><span style="color: yellow;">Adafruit:  'NeoPixel Uberguide'</span></a><br />The "NeoPixel" string of LEDs are super, in that they are individually programmable. &nbsp;A bit pricer, however. &nbsp;Each LED is individually addressable by a computer signal, enabling each LED to have its own intensity in Red, Green or Blue (RGB). &nbsp;These can be programmed by Arduinos, among other platforms.<br /><br /><a href="http://amzn.com/B00DTOAWZ2" target="_blank"><span style="background-color: black; color: yellow;">SuperNight LED strip on Amazon</span></a><br />These SuperNight LED strips are cheaper, but, from what I can tell, can only be programmed by the whole string being one color and one color only. &nbsp;You can make the color different, but it is still one color for all lights on the string at any one time. &nbsp;And I don't know how to use an Arduino to program it. <br /><br />Multiple vendors sell these strings. &nbsp;To get them working, you'll need to read the directions pretty carefully. &nbsp;I had to do a bit of soldering and a little Arduino programming. &nbsp;Once I got all the parts in place, it took me about a day to get everything running properly. <br /><br /><br /><br />
