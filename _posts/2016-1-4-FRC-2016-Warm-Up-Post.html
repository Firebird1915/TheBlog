FIRST has significantly changed the layout of their website for 2016. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/competition-manual-qa-system"><span style="color: yellow;">COMPETITION MANUAL PAGE LINK</span></a>. &nbsp;Members of Team 1915 will have to do their homework to ensure success. &nbsp; For starters, all team members must have the encrypted rules on their mobile device(s) (iPad, iPhone, Android, whatever) prior to the kickoff on January 9. &nbsp;The administrative rules are already posted; the encrypted game rules will be posted prior to kickoff, usually by Thursday. <br /><br />Other important FRC links will be posted below, as I learn about them:<br /><br /><a href="https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485"><span style="color: yellow;">2016 FRC Control System</span>&nbsp;</a>: &nbsp;EVERYONE on the team should know the control system components, the name of each component and its basic function. &nbsp;Build team electricians and computer programmers should know these documents very well, and use them on a regular basis.<br /><br />Various teams of engineers may be posting useful videos/comments on the "Robot in 3 days" webpages. &nbsp;Team members should subscribe to these sites and follow the progress of the various engineering teams. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.robotin3days.com/"><span style="color: yellow;">http://www.robotin3days.com/</span></a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/robotin3days"><span style="color: yellow;">https://www.youtube.com/user/robotin3days</span></a><br /><br /><a href="file:///C:/Grove/Downloads/2015-frc-pneumatics-manual.pdf"><span style="color: yellow;">2015 FRC Pneumatics Manual</span></a>. &nbsp;Probably still quite relevant. &nbsp;And a <span style="color: yellow;"><a href="http://thinktank.wpi.edu/article/36"><span style="color: yellow;">Pneumatics Presentation</span></a>.</span><br /><br /><a href="http://motors.vex.com/introduction" style="color: yellow;"><span style="color: yellow;">Motor Power Documents</span>.</a><span style="color: yellow;">&nbsp; </span>VEXpro does a nice job of explaining DC motors, power, etc, very directly.<br /><span style="color: yellow;"><br /></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
